This is a project made for BGC engineering

The goal of this project is to develop a web application that manages the planned and actual work capacity of BGC Engineeringâ€™s various Software Development teams, and compare them to the planned workload. We are seeking to improve upon the previous implementation of a simple excel document, and create a more organized, intuitive, and less cluttered application.
